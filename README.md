### What Sinatra Profile Manager is
Sinatra Profile Manager__ is a very minimalist Sinatra web application that enables clients to:

- Register/Manage/Unregister an account based on a username and password combination
- Login/Logout of an account
- Inspect information through a profile page
- Guides the client using contextual/informative messages/errors.

### This application is purely a personal exercise and not to be deployed.
